## Getting started

Before you begin:

## Contributions we are looking for

There are many ways you can contribute to the Special Tasks project:
- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting enhancements
- Writing or improving documentation
- Submitting pull requests to resolve issues or add features

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/divyesh1099/special_tasks/issues) to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pull-requests) with a fix.

**Please see the [Issues](https://github.com/divyesh1099/special_tasks/issues) page before you submit to avoid duplication.**

## Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are also a great way to contribute. Please submit them as [new issues](https://github.com/divyesh1099/special_tasks/issues/new).

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Special Tasks? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/divyesh1099/special_tasks/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/divyesh1099/special_tasks/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain Special Tasks's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Special Tasks
- Enable a sustainable system for Special Tasks's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

### Documentation Styleguide

  }
  ```
